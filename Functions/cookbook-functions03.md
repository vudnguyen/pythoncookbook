Python Cookbook: Functions
 Step 3 of 9 

Attaching Informational Metadata to Function Arguments

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Problem
-------------
You’ve written a function, but would like to attach some additional 
information to the arguments so that others know more about how a 
function is supposed to be used.


Solution
-------------
Function argument annotations can be a useful way to give programmers 
hints about how a function is supposed to be used. For example, 
consider the following annotated function:

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////


```

def add(x:int, y:int) -> int:
    return x + y

```

The Python interpreter does not attach any semantic meaning to the attached 
annotations. They are not type checks, nor do they make Python behave any 
differently than it did before. However, they might give useful hints to 
others reading the source code about what you had in mind. Third-party 
tools and frameworks might also attach semantic meaning to the annotations. 
They also appear in documentation:


$ help(add)

>>> Help on function add in module __main__:

>>> add(x: int, y: int) -> int


Although you can attach any kind of object to a function as an annotation 
(e.g., numbers, strings, instances, etc.), classes or strings often 
seem to make the most sense.


Discussion
-------------
Function annotations are merely stored in a 
function’s _annotations_ attribute. For example:

>>> add.__annotations__


Although there are many potential uses of annotations, their primary utility is 
probably just documentation. Because Python doesn’t have type declarations, 
it can often be difficult to know what you’re supposed to pass into a function 
if you’re simply reading its source code in isolation. An annotation gives 
someone more of a hint.
