Python Cookbook: Functions
 Step 6 of 9 

Defining Anonymous or Inline Functions

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Problem
-------------
You need to supply a short callback function for use with an 
operation such as sort(), but you don’t want to write a 
separate one-line function using the def statement. Instead, 
you’d like a shortcut that allows you to specify the 
function "in line."


Solution
-------------
Simple functions that do nothing more than evaluate 
an expression can be replaced by a lambda expression. 

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////


For example:

$ add = lambda x, y: x + y
$ add(2,3)
$ add('hello', 'world')


The use of lambda here is the same as 
having typed this:

```

def add(x, y):
    return x + y

```

$ add(2,3)


Typically, lambda is used in the context of some other 
operation, such as sorting or a data reduction:


$ names = ['David Beazley', 'Brian Jones', 'Raymond Hettinger', 'Ned Batchelder']
$ sorted(names, key=lambda name: name.split()[-1].lower())
# sorted(testNames, key=lambda name: name.split()[-1].lower())



Discussion
-------------
Although lambda allows you to define a simple function, its 
use is highly restricted. In particular, only a single 
expression can be specified, the result of which is the 
return value. This means that no other language features, 
including multiple statements, conditionals, iteration, and 
exception handling, can be included.

You can quite happily write a lot of Python code without ever 
using lambda. However, you’ll occasionally encounter it in 
programs where someone is writing a lot of tiny functions that 
evaluate various expressions, or in programs that require users 
to supply callback functions.
