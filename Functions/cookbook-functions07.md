Capturing Variables in Anonymous Functions


////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Problem
-------------
Youâ€™ve defined an anonymous function using lambda, but you also 
need to capture the values of certain variables at the time 
of definition.


Solution
-------------
Consider the behavior of the following code:

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////


$ x = 10
$ a = lambda y: x + y
$ x = 20
$ b = lambda y: x + y


Now ask yourself a question. What are the values of a(10) and b(10)? 
If you think the results might be 20 and 30, you would be wrong:

$ a(10)
$ b(10)


The problem here is that the value of x used in the lambda expression 
is a free variable that gets bound at runtime, not definition time. 
Thus, the value of x in the lambda expressions is whatever the value 
of the x variable happens to be at the time of execution. For example:


$ x = 15
$ a(10)
$ x = 3
$ a(10)


If you want an anonymous function to capture a value at the point of 
definition and keep it, include the value as a default value, 
like this:

$ x = 10
$ a = lambda y, x=x: x + y
$ x = 20
$ b = lambda y, x=x: x + y
$ a(10)
$ b(10)


Discussion
-------------
The problem addressed in this recipe is something that tends to come 
up in code that tries to be just a little bit too clever with the 
use of lambda functions. For example, creating a list of lambda 
expressions using a list comprehension or in a loop of some kind and 
expecting the lambda functions to remember the iteration variable 
at the time of definition. For example:

```

funcs = [lambda x: x+n for n in range(5)]
for f in funcs:
    print(f(0))

```


Notice how all functions think that n has the last value during iteration. 
Now compare to the following:

```

funcs = [lambda x, n=n: x+n for n in range(5)]
for f in funcs:
    print(f(0))

```

As you can see, the functions now capture the value of n at the 
time of definition.
