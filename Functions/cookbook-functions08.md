# Inlining Callback Functions

## Problem

You’re writing code that uses callback functions, but you’re
concerned about the proliferation of small functions and mind
boggling control flow. You would like some way to make the
code look more like a normal sequence of procedural steps.

## Solution

Callback functions can be inlined into a function
using generators and coroutines.

<hr>

To illustrate, suppose you have a function that performs work and invokes a callback as follows :

```

def apply_async(func, args, *, callback):
    # Compute the result
    result = func(*args)
    # Invoke the callback with the result
    callback(result)

```

Now take a look at the following supporting code, which involves
an Async class and an inlined_async decorator:

```

from queue import Queue
from functools import wraps

class Async(object):
    def __init__(self, func, args):
        self.func = func
        self.args = args

def inlined_async(func):
    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args):
        f = func(*args)
        result_queue = Queue()
        result_queue.put(None)
        while True:
            result = result_queue.get()
            try:
                a = f.send(result)
                apply_async(a.func, a.args, callback=result_queue.put)
            except StopIteration:
                break
    return wrapper

```

These two fragments of code will allow you to inline the
callback steps using yield statements. For example:

```

def add(x, y):
    return x + y

@inlined_async
def test():
    r = yield Async(add, (2, 3))
    print(r)
    r = yield Async(add, ('hello', 'world'))
    print(r)
    for n in range(10):
        r = yield Async(add, (n, n))
        print(r)
    print('Goodbye')

```

If you call test(), you’ll get output like this:

```
$ 5
$ helloworld
$ 0
$ 2
$ 4
$ 6
$ 8
$ 10
$ 12
$ 14
$ 16
$ 18
$ Goodbye

```

Aside from the special decorator and use of yield, you will
notice that no callback functions appear anywhere
(except behind the scenes).

## Discussion

This recipe will really test your knowledge of callback
functions, generators, and control flow.

First, in code involving callbacks, the whole point is that
the current calculation will suspend and resume at some later
point in time (e.g., asynchronously). When the calculation resumes,
the callback will get executed to continue the processing.
The apply_async() function illustrates the essential parts of
executing the callback, although in reality it might be much
more complicated (involving threads, processes, event handlers, etc.).

The idea that a calculation will suspend and resume naturally
maps to the execution model of a generator function. Specifically,
the yield operation makes a generator function emit a value
and suspend. Subsequent calls to the _next_() or send() method
of a generator will make it start again.

With this in mind, the core of this recipe is found in the
inline_async() decorator function. The key idea is that the
decorator will step the generator function through all of
its yield statements, one at a time. To do this, a result
queue is created and initially populated with a value of
None. A loop is then initiated in which a result is popped
off the queue and sent into the generator. This advances
to the next yield, at which point an instance of Async is
received. The loop then looks at the function and arguments,
and initiates the asynchronous calculation apply_async().
However, the sneakiest part of this calculation is that
instead of using a normal callback function, the callback
is set to the queue put() method.

At this point, it is left somewhat open as to precisely what
happens. The main loop immediately goes back to the top and
simply executes a get() operation on the queue. If data is
present, it must be the result placed there by the put()
callback. If nothing is there, the operation blocks,
waiting for a result to arrive at some future time. How
that might happen depends on the precise implementation
of the apply_async() function.

If you’re doubtful that anything this crazy would work,
you can try it with the multiprocessing library and have
async operations executed in separate processes:

```

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import multiprocessing
    pool = multiprocessing.Pool()
    apply_async = pool.apply_async
    # Run the test function
    test()

```

Indeed, you’ll find that it works, but unraveling
the control flow might require more coffee.

Hiding tricky control flow behind generator functions
is found elsewhere in the standard library and third-party
packages. For example, the @contextmanager decorator in
the contextlib performs a similar mind-bending trick that
glues the entry and exit from a context manager together
across a yield statement. The popular Twisted package
has inlined callbacks that are also similar.
