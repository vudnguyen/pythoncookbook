Defining Functions with Default Arguments

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Problem
-------------
You want to define a function or method where one or more of the 
arguments are optional and have a default value.


Solution
-------------
On the surface, defining a function with optional arguments is 
easy—​simply assign values in the definition and make sure that 
default arguments appear last. 

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////


For example:

```

def spam(a, b=42):
    print(a, b)

```

$ spam(1)      # Ok. a=1, b=42
$ spam(1, 2)   # Ok. a=1, b=2



If the default value is supposed to be a mutable container, 
such as a list, set, or dictionary, use None as the default 
and write code like this:


# Using a list as a default value

```

def spam(a, b=None):
    if b is None:
        b = []

```

If, instead of providing a default value, you want to write 
code that merely tests whether an optional argument was 
given an interesting value or not, use this idiom:


```

_no_value = object()

def spam(a, b=_no_value):
    if b is _no_value:
        print('No b value supplied')

```


Here’s how this function behaves:

$ spam(1)
$ spam(1, 2)     # b = 2
$ spam(1, None)  # b = None


Carefully observe that there is a distinction between passing no 
value at all and passing a value of None.


Discussion
-------------
Defining functions with default arguments is easy, but there is a 
bit more to it than meets the eye.

First, the values assigned as a default are bound only once at the 
time of function definition. Try this example to see it:

```

x = 42
def spam(a, b=x):
    print(a, b)

```

$ spam(1)
$ x = 23     # Has no effect
$ spam(1)


Notice how changing the variable x (which was used as a default value) 
has no effect whatsoever. This is because the default value was fixed 
at function definition time.

Second, the values assigned as defaults should always be immutable objects, 
such as None, True, False, numbers, or strings. Specifically, never 
write code like this:

$ def spam(a, b=[]):     # NO!


If you do this, you can run into all sorts of trouble if the default 
value ever escapes the function and gets modified. Such changes 
will permanently alter the default value across future function calls. 
For example:

```

def spam(a, b=[]):
    print(b)
    return b

```

$ x = spam(1)
$ x
$ x.append(99)
$ x.append('Yow!')
$ x
$ spam(1)       # Modified list gets returned!


That’s probably not what you want. To avoid this, it’s better to assign 
None as a default and add a check inside the function for it, as shown 
in the solution.

The use of the is operator when testing for None is a critical part 
of this recipe. Sometimes people make this mistake:

```

def spam(a, b=None):
    if not b:      # NO! Use 'b is None' instead
        b = []

```

The problem here is that although None evaluates to False, many other 
objects (e.g., zero-length strings, lists, tuples, dicts, etc.) do 
as well. Thus, the test just shown would falsely treat certain inputs 
as missing. For example:


$ spam(1)        # OK
$ x = []
$ spam(1, x)     # Silent error. x value overwritten by default
$ spam(1, 0)     # Silent error. 0 ignored
$ spam(1, '')    # Silent error. '' ignored



The last part of this recipe is something that’s rather subtle—​a function 
that tests to see whether a value (any value) has been supplied to an 
optional argument or not. The tricky part here is that you can’t use a 
default value of None, 0, or False to test for the presence of a 
user-supplied argument (since all of these are perfectly valid values that 
a user might supply). Thus, you need something else to test against.

To solve this problem, you can create a unique private instance of object, 
as shown in the solution (the _no_value variable). In the function, 
you then check the identity of the supplied argument against this special 
value to see if an argument was supplied or not. The thinking here is 
that it would be extremely unlikely for a user to pass the _no_value 
instance in as an input value. Therefore, it becomes a safe value to 
check against if you’re trying to determine whether an argument was 
supplied or not.

The use of object() might look rather unusual here. object is a class that 
serves as the common base class for almost all objects in Python. You 
can create instances of object, but they are wholly uninteresting, as 
they have no notable methods nor any instance data (because there is no 
underlying instance dictionary, you can’t even set any attributes). About 
the only thing you can do is perform tests for identity. This makes them 
useful as special values, as shown in the solution.
