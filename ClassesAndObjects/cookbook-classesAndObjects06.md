# Making Classes Support Comparison Operations

## Problem

---

You’d like to be able to compare instances of your
class using the standard comparison operators
(e.g., >=, !=, ⇐, etc.), but without having to
write a lot of special methods.

## Solution

---

Python classes can support comparison by implementing
a special method for each comparison operator.
For example, to support the >= operator, you define
a **ge**() method in the classes. Although defining
a single method is usually no problem, it quickly
gets tedious to create implementations of every
possible comparison operator.

The functools.total_ordering decorator can be used to
simplify this process. To use it, you decorate a
class with it, and define **eq**() and one other
comparison method (**lt**, **le**, **gt**, or **ge**).
The decorator then fills in the other comparison
methods for you.

As an example, let’s build some houses and add some
rooms to them, and then perform comparisons based
on the size of the houses:

```

from functools import total_ordering
class Room(object):
    def **init**(self, name, length, width):
    self.name = name
    self.length = length
    self.width = width
    self.square_feet = self.length * self.width

@total_ordering
class House(object):
    def **init**(self, name, style):
    self.name = name
    self.style = style
    self.rooms = list()
@property
def living_space_footage(self):
    return sum(r.square_feet for r in self.rooms)
def add_room(self, room):
    self.rooms.append(room)
def **str**(self):
    return '{}: {} square foot {}'.format(self.name, self.living_space_footage, self.style)
def **eq**(self, other):
    return self.living_space_footage == other.living_space_footage
def **lt**(self, other):
    return self.living_space_footage < other.living_space_footage

```

Here, the House class has been decorated with @total_ordering.
Definitions of **eq**() and **lt**() are provided to compare
houses based on the total square footage of their rooms.
This minimum definition is all that is required to make all
of the other comparison operations work. For example:

```

# Build a few houses, and add rooms to them

h1 = House('h1', 'Cape')
h1.add_room(Room('Master Bedroom', 14, 21))
h1.add_room(Room('Living Room', 18, 20))
h1.add_room(Room('Kitchen', 12, 16))
h1.add_room(Room('Office', 12, 12))

h2 = House('h2', 'Ranch')
h2.add_room(Room('Master Bedroom', 14, 21))
h2.add_room(Room('Living Room', 18, 20))
h2.add_room(Room('Kitchen', 12, 16))

h3 = House('h3', 'Split')
h3.add_room(Room('Master Bedroom', 14, 21))
h3.add_room(Room('Living Room', 18, 20))
h3.add_room(Room('Office', 12, 16))
h3.add_room(Room('Kitchen', 15, 17))
houses = [h1, h2, h3]

# prints True
print('Is h1 bigger than h2?', h1 > h2)

# prints True
print('Is h2 smaller than h3?', h2 < h3)

# Prints False
print('Is h2 greater than or equal to h1?', h2 >= h1)

# Prints 'h3: 1101-square-foot Split'
print('Which one is biggest?', max(houses))

# Prints 'h2: 846-square-foot Ranch'
print('Which is smallest?', min(houses))


```

## Discussion

---

If you’ve written the code to make a class support all
of the basic comparison operators, then total_ordering
probably doesn’t seem all that magical: it literally
defines a mapping from each of the comparison-supporting
methods to all of the other ones that would be required.
So, if you defined **lt**() in your class as in the
solution, it is used to build all of the other comparison
operators. It’s really just filling in the class with
methods like this:

```

class House(object):
    def **eq**(self, other):
    ...
    def **lt**(self, other):
    ...

    # Methods created by @total_ordering
    __le__ = lambda self, other: self < other or self == other
    __gt__ = lambda self, other: not (self < other or self == other)
    __ge__ = lambda self, other: not (self < other)
    __ne__ = lambda self, other: not self == other

```

Sure, it’s not hard to write these methods yourself,
but @total_ordering simply takes the guesswork out of it.
