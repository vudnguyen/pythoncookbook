# Implementing a Data Model or Type System

## Problem

---

You want to define various kinds of data structures,
but want to enforce constraints on the values that
are allowed to be assigned to certain attributes.

## Solution

---

In this problem, you are basically faced with the task
of placing checks or assertions on the setting of
certain instance attributes. To do this, you need to
customize the setting of attributes on a per-attribute
basis. To do this, you should use descriptors.

The following code illustrates the use of descriptors
to implement a system type and value
checking framework:

```

# Base class. Uses a descriptor to set a value
class Descriptor(object):
    def __init__(self, name=None, **opts):
        self.name = name
        for key, value in opts.items():
            setattr(self, key, value)
    def __set__(self, instance, value):
        instance.__dict__[self.name] = value

# Descriptor for enforcing types
class Typed(Descriptor):
    expected_type = type(None)
    def __set__(self, instance, value):
        if not isinstance(value, self.expected_type):
            raise TypeError('expected ' + str(self.expected_type))
        super().__set__(instance, value)

# Descriptor for enforcing values
class Unsigned(Descriptor):
    def __set__(self, instance, value):
        if value < 0:
            raise ValueError('Expected >= 0')
        super().__set__(instance, value)

class MaxSized(Descriptor):
    def __init__(self, name=None, **opts):
        if 'size' not in opts:
            raise TypeError('missing size option')
        super().__init__(name, **opts)
    def __set__(self, instance, value):
        if len(value) >= self.size:
            raise ValueError('size must be < ' + str(self.size))
        super().__set__(instance, value)

```

These classes should be viewed as basic building blocks from which
you construct a data model or type system. Continuing, here is
some code that implements some different kinds of data:

```

class Integer(Typed):
    expected_type = int

class UnsignedInteger(Integer, Unsigned):
    pass

class Float(Typed):
    expected_type = float

class UnsignedFloat(Float, Unsigned):
    pass

class String(Typed):
    expected_type = str

class SizedString(String, MaxSized):
    pass

```

Using these type objects, it is now possible to define a
class such as this:

```

class Stock(object):
    # Specify constraints
    name = SizedString('name',size=8)
    shares = UnsignedInteger('shares')
    price = UnsignedFloat('price')
    def __init__(self, name, shares, price):
        self.name = name
        self.shares = shares
        self.price = price

```

With the constraints in place, you’ll find that assigning of
attributes is now validated. For example:

```

$ s = Stock('ACME', 50, 91.1)
$ s.name
$ s.shares = 75
$ s.shares = -10 # Results in an error
$ s.price = 'a lot'  # Results in an error
$ s.name = 'ABRACADABRA' # Results in an error

```

There are some techniques that can be used to simplify
the specification of constraints in classes. One approach
is to use a class decorator, like this:

```

# Class decorator to apply constraints
def check_attributes(**kwargs):
    def decorate(cls):
        for key, value in kwargs.items():
            if isinstance(value, Descriptor):
                value.name = key
                setattr(cls, key, value)
            else:
                setattr(cls, key, value(key))
        return cls
    return decorate

# Example
@check_attributes(name=SizedString(size=8),
                  shares=UnsignedInteger,
                  price=UnsignedFloat)
class Stock(object):
    def __init__(self, name, shares, price):
        self.name = name
        self.shares = shares
        self.price = price

```

Another approach to simplify the specification of constraints
is to use a metaclass. For example:

```

# A metaclass that applies checking
class checkedmeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, clsname, bases, methods):
        # Attach attribute names to the descriptors
        for key, value in methods.items():
            if isinstance(value, Descriptor):
                value.name = key
        return type.__new__(cls, clsname, bases, methods)

# Example
class Stock(metaclass=checkedmeta):
    name   = SizedString(size=8)
    shares = UnsignedInteger()
    price  = UnsignedFloat()
    def __init__(self, name, shares, price):
        self.name = name
        self.shares = shares
        self.price = price

```

## Discussion

---

This recipe involves a number of advanced techniques,
including descriptors, mixin classes, the use of
super(), class decorators, and metaclasses. Covering
the basics of all those topics is beyond what can be
covered here, but examples can be found in other
recipes. However, there are a number of subtle
points worth noting.

First, in the Descriptor base class, you will notice
that there is a **set**() method, but no corresponding
**get**(). If a descriptor will do nothing more than
extract an identically named value from the underlying
instance dictionary, defining **get**() is unnecessary.
In fact, defining _get_() will just make it run slower.
Thus, this recipe only focuses on the implementation
of **set**().

The overall design of the various descriptor classes
is based on mixin classes. For example, the Unsigned
and MaxSized classes are meant to be mixed with the
other descriptor classes derived from Typed. To handle
a specific kind of data type, multiple inheritance is
used to combine the desired functionality.

You will also notice that all **init**() methods of
the various descriptors have been programmed to have
an identical signature involving keyword arguments
\*\*opts. The class for MaxSized looks for its required
attribute in opts, but simply passes it along to the
Descriptor base class, which actually sets it.
One tricky part about composing classes like this
(especially mixins), is that you don’t always know how
the classes are going to be chained together or what
super() will invoke. For this reason, you need to make
it work with any possible combination of classes.

The definitions of the various type classes such as
Integer, Float, and String illustrate a useful technique
of using class variables to customize an implementation.
The Typed descriptor merely looks for an expected_type
attribute that is provided by each of those subclasses.

The use of a class decorator or metaclass is often useful
for simplifying the specification by the user. You will
notice that in those examples, the user no longer has to
type the name of the attribute more than once.
For example:

```
# Normal

class Point(object):
    x = Integer('x')
    y = Integer('y')

# Metaclass

class Point(metaclass=checkedmeta):
    x = Integer()
    y = Integer()

```

The code for the class decorator and metaclass simply scan
the class dictionary looking for descriptors. When found,
they simply fill in the descriptor name based on the
key value.

Of all the approaches, the class decorator solution may
provide the most flexibility and sanity. For one, it does
not rely on any advanced machinery, such as metaclasses.
Second, decoration is something that can easily be added
or removed from a class definition as desired. For example,
within the decorator, there could be an option to simply
omit the added checking altogether. These might allow the
checking to be something that could be turned on or off
depending on demand (maybe for debugging versus production).

As a final twist, a class decorator approach can also be used
as a replacement for mixin classes, multiple inheritance,
and tricky use of the super() function. Here is an alternative
formulation of this recipe that uses class decorators:

```
# Base class. Uses a descriptor to set a value

class Descriptor(object):
  def **init**(self, name=None, \*\*opts):
    self.name = name
    for key, value in opts.items():
    setattr(self, key, value)
    def **set**(self, instance, value):
    instance.**dict**[self.name] = value

# Decorator for applying type checking

def Typed(expected_type, cls=None):
    if cls is None:
        return lambda cls: Typed(expected_type, cls)
    super_set = cls.**set**
    def **set**(self, instance, value):
    if not isinstance(value, expected_type):
        raise TypeError('expected ' + str(expected_type))
    super_set(self, instance, value)
        cls.**set** = **set**
    return cls

# Decorator for unsigned values

def Unsigned(cls):
    super_set = cls.**set**
    def **set**(self, instance, value):
    if value < 0:
        raise ValueError('Expected >= 0')
    super_set(self, instance, value)
    cls.**set** = **set**
    return cls

# Decorator for allowing sized values

def MaxSized(cls):
    super_init = cls.**init**
    def **init**(self, name=None, **opts):
    if 'size' not in opts:
        raise TypeError('missing size option')
    super_init(self, name, **opts)
    cls.**init** = **init**
    super_set = cls.**set**
    def **set**(self, instance, value):
    if len(value) >= self.size:
        raise ValueError('size must be < ' + str(self.size))
    super_set(self, instance, value)
    cls.**set** = **set**
    return cls

# Specialized descriptors

@Typed(int)
class Integer(Descriptor):
    pass

@Unsigned
class UnsignedInteger(Integer):
    pass

@Typed(float)
class Float(Descriptor):
    pass

@Unsigned
class UnsignedFloat(Float):
    pass

@Typed(str)
class String(Descriptor):
    pass

@MaxSized
class SizedString(String):
    pass

```

The classes defined in this alternative formulation
work in exactly the same manner as before (none of
the earlier example code changes) except that
everything runs much faster. For example, a simple
timing test of setting a typed attribute reveals
that the class decorator approach runs almost 100%
faster than the approach using mixins. Now aren’t
you glad you read all the way to the end?
