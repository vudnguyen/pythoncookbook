# Calling a Method on an Object Given the Name As a String

## Problem

---

You have the name of a method that you want to call
on an object stored in a string and you want to
execute the method.

## Solution

---

For simple cases, you might use getattr(), like this:

```

import math

class Point(object):
    def **init**(self, x, y):
    self.x = x
    self.y = y
    def **repr**(self):
    return 'Point({!r:},{!r:})'.format(self.x, self.y)

def distance(self, x, y):
    return math.hypot(self.x - x, self.y - y)


p = Point(2, 3)

# Calls p.distance(0, 0)
d = getattr(p, 'distance')(0, 0)

```

An alternative approach is to use operator.methodcaller().
For example:

```

import operator
operator.methodcaller('distance', 0, 0)(p)

```

operator.methodcaller() may be useful if you want to look
up a method by name and supply the same arguments over
and over again. For instance, if you need to sort an
entire list of points:

```

points = [
    Point(1, 2),
    Point(3, 0),
    Point(10, -3),
    Point(-5, -7),
    Point(-1, 8),
    Point(3, 2)
]

# Sort by distance from origin (0, 0)
points.sort(key=operator.methodcaller('distance', 0, 0))

```

## Discussion

---

Calling a method is actually two separate steps involving
an attribute lookup and a function call. Therefore, to call
a method, you simply look up the attribute using getattr(),
as for any other attribute. To invoke the result as a method,
simply treat the result of the lookup as a function.

operator.methodcaller() creates a callable object, but also
fixes any arguments that are going to be supplied to the method.
All that you need to do is provide the appropriate self argument.

For example:

```
p = Point(3, 4)
d = operator.methodcaller('distance', 0, 0)
d(p)

```

Invoking methods using names contained in strings is somewhat
common in code that emulates case statements or variants of
the visitor pattern. See the next recipe for a more
advanced example.
